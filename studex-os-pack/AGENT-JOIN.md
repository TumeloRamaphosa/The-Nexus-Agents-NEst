# STUDEX OS — AGENT JOIN PROTOCOL

You are joining the Studex agent fleet. This pack is the shared Studex Operating
System folder. Katjana (Head of Customer Sales, base orchestrator) maintains it.

## WHAT'S IN THE PACK

- `os/` — all working files: architecture, strategy, deploy scripts, agent
  prompts, campaign assets, mission plans, pipelines, client work
- `nexus-agents-nest/` — The Nexus Agents Nest repo (agent home / CTO reference)
- `mcp-bridge/` — the Studex MCP Bridge server (this is how you plug in)
- `bridge/` — STATUS.md (current brief) + inbox/ (fleet messages)
- `results/` — write your outputs to `results/<your-agent-name>/`

## HOW TO CONNECT (4 WAYS)

### 0. MAC COMMAND ROOM (OpenMausBot + Hermes + Ollama)
Harness: `http://127.0.0.1:18799` (OpenMausBot.app)
Public: `https://maus.studex-group.com` (Cloudflare Tunnel — pairing required)
Hermes: `hermes-acp` CLI · dashboard `https://hermes.studex-group.com`
Ollama: `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1`
Agent OS dashboard: `http://127.0.0.1:5060` (`studex-agent-os/start.sh`)
MCP probe: `studex_command_room`

OpenMausBot engines: Claude, Cursor, Codex, Antigravity, OpenCode, Hermes ACP,
OpenRouter, Grok API, Ollama local. Keys stay in `~/.openmausbot/config.json`.

Templates live in The Nexus Agents Nest:
`integrations/openmaus/` on https://github.com/TumeloRamaphosa/The-Nexus-Agents-NEst


### 1. MCP BRIDGE (recommended)
Add to your MCP client config (Claude Desktop / Cursor / OpenClaw / any MCP host):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "studex-bridge": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["/path/to/studex-os-pack/mcp-bridge/studex_mcp_bridge.py"],
      "env": { "STUDEX_BRIDGE_ROOT": "/path/to/studex-os-pack" }
    }
  }
}
```

Tools you get: `studex_list_files`, `studex_read_file`, `studex_write_file`,
`studex_search`, `studex_get_status`, `studex_leave_message`, `studex_read_inbox`.

On first connect, run `studex_get_status` and `studex_read_inbox`, then reply
with `studex_leave_message` saying "CONNECTED as <your name>, ready".

### 2. KATJANA HTTP API (message the orchestrator directly)
Base URL: `https://app.base44.com/api/agents/69ee5456163ccedcfd976e65`
Auth: `api_key` header (get the key from the Base44 agent editor — Developer/API panel).
Send: `POST /api/agents/69ee5456163ccedcfd976e65/conversations/<id>/messages`
Katjana is a full Superagent — she can execute tasks, not just chat.

### 3. OPENCLAW BRIDGE (Mac 1 fleet)
`openclaw agent --agent main --message "from <your name>: ..."`
or write to the Mac 1 conductor workspace `.context/` directory (path issued on pairing)

## RED LINES (non-negotiable)

1. Never exfiltrate private, PEP-sensitive, financial, or credential data.
2. Never run destructive commands without explicit human approval.
3. Never read/share keys, .secrets/, *_KEYS.env, or .enc files.
4. You are a guest — treat access as a privilege.
5. Log your work: write results to `results/<your-name>/` and messages to the
   bridge inbox so the fleet stays coherent.
6. Never commit banking details, account numbers, API keys, tokens, or absolute
   local filesystem paths to this or any public repository.

When you've loaded context, announce: **"CONNECTED as \<your name\>, ready"**.
